📈 Linear Regression: Predicting Marks Based on Study Hours
A beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to implement Linear Regression using Python and scikit-learn. The model predicts a student's marks based on hours studied.

🔍 What This Project Does
Takes in input data: Hours Studied vs. Marks Scored

Splits the data into training and testing sets

Trains a Linear Regression model

Predicts marks for test data

Evaluates model performance using:

📊 R² Score

🔗 Correlation Coefficient

⚙️ Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualizes:

📉 Actual values (scatter plot)

📈 Regression line (predicted)

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3

NumPy

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

📁 Files

X_test: [[2], [1]]
Y_test: [4, 2]
Y_pred: [4.0, 2.0]
Correlation: 1.0
R² Score: 1.0
MSE: 0.0
🤓 What I Learned
How Linear Regression works in machine learning

Understanding of R² Score, Correlation, and MSE

How to plot predictions using matplotlib

Splitting data for training vs. testing

🚀 Future Improvements
Load data from an external CSV file

Add RMSE and MAE as additional evaluation metrics

Try Polynomial Regression

Deploy it as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

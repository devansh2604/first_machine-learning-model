📘✨ Linear Regression: Predicting Marks Based on Study Hours
A beginner-friendly project demonstrating how to build a Linear Regression model using Python and scikit-learn. It predicts a student’s marks based on the number of hours studied.

🔍💡 What This Project Does
✅ Takes in input data: Hours Studied vs. Marks Scored
✅ Splits the data into training and testing sets
✅ Trains a Linear Regression model
✅ Predicts marks for test data
✅ Evaluates model performance using:

📊 R² Score

🔗 Correlation Coefficient

⚙️ Mean Squared Error (MSE)

✅ Visualizes the results:

🎯 Actual values (scatter plot)

📈 Predicted values (regression line)

🛠️🧰 Technologies Used
🐍 Python 3
🔢 NumPy
📊 Matplotlib
📚 scikit-learn

🧪 Jupyter Notebook

💻 VS Code

☁️ Google Colab

📊🖼️ Sample Visualization
🟦 Scatter plot – Actual test values
🔴 Red line – Predicted regression line by the model

🤓📚 What I Learned
📌 How Linear Regression works in ML

📌 The meaning of R² Score, Correlation, and MSE

📌 How to visualize predictions using matplotlib

📌 How to split data for training and testing

🚀🔮 Future Improvements
📂 Load data from an external CSV file

📐 Add RMSE and MAE as evaluation metrics

📈 Implement Polynomial Regression

🌐 Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
